Only, Jelly doesn't know it yet.\n\nOne day, Jelly swims deeper into the ocean. It's very dark down here! The sun doesn't reach this deep! Jelly can barely see anything. Black water all around. \"It's so dark,\" thinks Jelly nervously.\n\nSuddenly, Jelly starts to glow! Her body lights up! Soft blue light!

A tiny fish swims over. \"You're glowing! How beautiful!\" Jelly feels shy. \"I am?\" \"Yes!\" says the fish. \"Your light helps me see in the dark!\" More creatures come to see the glowing jellyfish.\n\nJelly swims around. Her light lights up the dark ocean! Fish follow her. They can see where they're going now! \"Thank you, Jelly!\" say the fish. Jelly feels happy.

    "content": "Jake has new shoes with laces!\n\nNot velcro. Real laces that tie!\n\n\"Can you teach me?\" Jake asks Dad.\n\nDad sits down. \"Let's learn together!\"\n\nJake is ready to be a big kid!\n\n\"First, make an X with the laces,\" says Dad.\n\nJake crosses the laces. X!\n\n\"Good!\" says Dad. \"Now pull one lace through the bottom.\"\n\nJake pulls. It makes a knot!\n\n\"I did it!\" says Jake.\n\n\"Now comes the tricky part,\" says Dad. \"Make two bunny ears!\"\n\nJake tries to make loops. One lace becomes a loop!\n\nBut the other lace won't loop right. It's too short!\n\n\"Oops,\" says Jake.\n\n\"That's okay. Try again,\" says Dad.\n\nJake tries again. Both laces make loops this time!\n\nThey look like bunny ears!\n\n\"Perfect!\" says Dad. \"Now tie the bunny ears together.\"\n\nJake tries. The loops twist. They fall apart!\n\n\"Argh!\" says Jake.\n\nJake keeps trying. Again and again!\n\nSometimes the loops are too loose. Sometimes too tight!\n\nSometimes they fall apart. Sometimes they make a knot!\n\n\"I can't do it!\" says Jake, frustrated.\n\n\"Yes you can,\" says Dad. \"Keep trying!\"\n\nJake tries one more time.\n\nX. Pull through. Two bunny ears. Tie them together. Pull!\n\nThe bow stays! A real bow!\n\n\"I DID IT!\" shouts Jake. \"I tied my shoe!\"\n\nDad gives him a high-five. \"You didn't give up!\"\n\nJake looks at his tied shoe. He's such a big kid now!",

It's huge!\n\nThe bed has pink sheets and a soft pillow.\n\nAva climbs up using a step stool!\n\nShe sits on the bed. Bounces a little. Boing, boing!\n\n\"It's so big!\" says Ava.\n\nShe lies down. So much space!\n\nThat night, bedtime comes.\n\nMama tucks Ava into the big bed.\n\n\"Goodnight, big girl,\" says Mama.\n\nShe turns off the light and leaves.\n\nAva lies in the dark. The bed feels VERY big.\n\nAva looks around. Everything looks different from this bed!\n\nShe can see the door. The window. The toy shelf.\n\nIt's a little bit scary.\n\nThe bed is so big. Ava feels so small!\n\n\"Mama?\" calls Ava quietly.\n\nMama comes back. \"What's wrong, sweetie?\"\n\n\"The bed is too big,\" whispers Ava. \"I feel small.\"\n\nMama sits on the edge. \"Want your stuffed bunny?\"\n\nAva nods. Mama gives her the soft bunny.\n\nAva hugs it close. That's better!\n\n\"Big beds are for big girls,\" says Mama. \"And you're getting bigger every day!\"\n\nAva thinks about that. She IS bigger than before!\n\n\"I can do this,\" says Ava. \"I'm a big girl!\"\n\nMama kisses her forehead. \"Yes you are.\"\n\nAva closes her eyes. Her big girl bed doesn't feel scary anymore!",

Some are playing with blocks. Some are coloring.\n\nNoah's tummy feels funny.\n\n\"I'll pick you up later,\" says Mama. \"Have fun!\"\n\nShe waves goodbye and leaves.\n\nNoah stands by the door. He doesn't know anyone!\n\nA teacher comes over. \"Hi! I'm Ms. Sara. What's your name?\"\n\n\"Noah,\" he says quietly.\n\n\"Want to play with blocks?\" asks Ms. Sara.\n\nNoah nods. Blocks are fun!\n\nNoah walks to the block area.\n\nAnother boy is building a tower.\n\n\"Hi,\" says Noah. \"Can I help?\"\n\nThe boy looks up. \"Sure! I'm making a castle!\"\n\n\"I'm Noah,\" says Noah.\n\n\"I'm Tyler!\" says the boy.\n\nNoah and Tyler build the castle together.\n\nThey add more blocks.
