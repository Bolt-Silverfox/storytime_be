The fog is too thick! The ship is heading straight for the dangerous rocks!\n\nThe lighthouse sees the ship through the fog. \"Oh no!\" thinks the lighthouse. \"The ship is too close to the rocks!\" The lighthouse spins its light faster! Brighter! Flash! Flash! Flash! \"Danger! Turn away!\" says the light.\n\nBut the ship still can't see the light! The fog is too thick! The lighthouse thinks hard. What can it do? Then the lighthouse remembers! It has a foghorn! HOOOOOONK! The lighthouse blows its foghorn! Loud and deep!\n\nThe ship hears the foghorn! \"That's a lighthouse!\" thinks the ship. \"There must be rocks nearby!\" The ship turns! Away from the rocks! Away from danger! The ship sails slowly, listening to the foghorn. HOOOOOONK! The lighthouse keeps blowing!\n\nFinally, the fog clears. The ship can see again! The ship sees the lighthouse standing tall on the cliff. \"Thank you, lighthouse!\" says the ship. \"You saved me!\" The lighthouse flashes its light. \"You're welcome!\" The lighthouse is proud. It did its job! It kept the ship safe!",

Today, Sara has a very important message to deliver. \"Take this to the baker,\" says the mayor. \"He needs it right away!\"\n\nSara takes the rolled-up note. She tucks it safely in her pouch. \"I'll run as fast as I can!\" says Sara. She starts running. Her feet move quickly. Through the village square. Past the fountain.\n\nSara runs down the cobblestone street. Left turn. Right turn. She knows every path in the village! She's delivered messages many times before. She's the fastest messenger there is!\n\nSara reaches the baker's shop. She's out of breath, but she made it! \"Message from the mayor!\" says Sara. The baker opens the note and reads it. His face lights up. \"Thank you, Sara! This is important news!\"\n\nThe baker gives Sara a fresh roll as a thank-you. Warm and delicious! Sara takes a bite. Yum! \"You're the best messenger we have,\" says the baker. Sara smiles proudly.\n\nSara runs back to the mayor. \"Message delivered!\" she reports. The mayor nods. \"Well done, Sara. The village needs fast, brave messengers like you.\" Sara stands tall. She may be small, but she's very important. Being a messenger is a big responsibility!",

Every night, the lighthouse's light warned ships about the rocks! Annie helped her father every day!\n\nEvery evening, Annie and her father climbed the spiral stairs. Round and round. Up and up! One hundred steps to the top! Annie counted as she climbed. \"Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred!\" They reached the top!\n\nAt the top was the big light. A huge glass lantern! Annie's father lit the lamp inside. Bright and warm! The light shone out across the dark ocean. \"Now the ships can see!\" said Father. Annie looked out at the water. So many stars above!\n\nAnnie's job was to polish the glass every day. She used a soft cloth. She wiped the glass clean! Round and round. Shiny and clear! \"The cleaner the glass, the brighter the light!\" said Father. Annie worked hard. She wanted the light to shine far!\n\nOne foggy night, the fog was very thick. Ships couldn't see the light through the fog! \"Ring the bell!\" said Father. Annie helped ring the big brass bell. CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! The sound warned ships even when they couldn't see the light!\n\nThe ships heard the bell. They turned away from the rocks! Safe! \"We did it!\" said Annie. Father hugged her. \"You're a good lighthouse keeper's daughter!\" Annie smiled. She helped keep ships safe! Every night, the lighthouse stood guard. And Annie helped!",

First, they walked past the old mill. The map showed it! Then, they crossed the wooden bridge. The map showed that too! \"The map is right!\" said Daniel. Grandfather smiled. \"I drew it carefully!\"\n\nNext, they climbed a small hill. At the top, they could see far away! Daniel looked at the map. \"What's next?\" \"The big oak tree!\" said Grandfather, pointing. They walked toward a huge oak tree. Just like on the map!\n\nUnder the oak tree, Grandfather stopped. \"This is the X!\" said Grandfather. Daniel looked around. \"What's here?\" Grandfather pointed at a flat rock. \"Lift that rock!\" Daniel lifted the rock. Underneath was a small metal box!\n\nDaniel opened the box. Inside were beautiful stones! Smooth and colorful! \"I collected these when I was your age,\" said Grandfather. \"I hid them here!\" \"They're beautiful!\" said Daniel. Grandfather smiled. \"Now they're yours. And one day, you can make your own map!\" Daniel held the map carefully. A treasure from the past!",
